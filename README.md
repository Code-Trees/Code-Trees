### Hola , ðŸ‘‹

I'm Pruthiraj Jayasingh, an Indian Ml/AI engineer who self-taught himself. My interest for Ml/AI is coming up with new concepts and bringing them to life via R&D.

In addition, I am an open-source supporter and maintainer. I learnt a lot from the open-source community, and I enjoy how it facilitates cooperation and information sharing.
